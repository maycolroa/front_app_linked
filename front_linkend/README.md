## Description

This proyect have diferents exercises with binay trees. binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set containing the root.

## Important Terms:

   Following are the important terms with respect to tree.

      * Path − Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.

      * Root − The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.

      * Parent − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.

      * Child − The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.

      * Leaf − The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.

      * Subtree − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.

      * Visiting − Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.

      * Traversing − Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.

      * Levels − Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.

      * keys − Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.
